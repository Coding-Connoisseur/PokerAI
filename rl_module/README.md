# RL Module Directory Breakdown

This breakdown details the structure and functional logic of all the files in the **`rl_module/`** directory, which will contain all the necessary components for implementing Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a poker AI. The directory will encompass logic for training, evaluating, and updating the agent's policy using Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

Each file will have a clearly defined responsibility within the system and contribute to the overall functionality of the RL agent.

## File Breakdown and Logic

### 1. **`agent.py`** - RL Agent Logic

This file defines the core logic for the reinforcement learning agent, including:
- **Q-learning logic**: Updates the Q-table for action-value function approximation.
- **Deep Q-Networks (optional)**: Uses a neural network for larger state spaces.
- **Action selection policy**: Epsilon-greedy policy for exploration vs exploitation.

#### Core Components:
```python
class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_space_size, action_space_size):
        self.q_table = np.zeros([state_space_size, action_space_size])  # Q-table initialization
        self.alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
        self.gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor
        self.epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration rate (for epsilon-greedy strategy)
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        """
        Epsilon-greedy action selection. 
        Chooses between exploration and exploitation based on epsilon.
        """
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < self.epsilon:
            return random.choice(range(len(ACTIONS)))  # Explore
        else:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])  # Exploit known Q-values
    
    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        """
        Q-learning update rule. Updates the Q-values based on action, reward, and next state.
        """
        best_next_action = np.argmax(self.q_table[next_state])
        td_target = reward + self.gamma * self.q_table[next_state][best_next_action]
        td_error = td_target - self.q_table[state][action]
        self.q_table[state][action] += self.alpha * td_error
```

### 2. **`environment.py`** - Poker Environment Simulation

This file handles the interaction between the agent and the poker environment. It includes:
- **State transitions**: Tracks game states (e.g., player's hand, community cards, pot size).
- **Action execution**: Implements how the poker actions (fold, raise, call, etc.) affect the state.
- **Reward generation**: Retrieves rewards from the reward module.

#### Core Components:
```python
class PokerEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = self.initialize_state()  # Initialize a new poker game state
    
    def initialize_state(self):
        """
        Create and return the initial game state, including player hands, community cards, pot size.
        """
        return {
            'player_hand': None,   # Placeholder for player cards
            'community_cards': [], # Placeholder for community cards
            'pot_size': 0,
            'player_position': None,
        }
    
    def step(self, action):
        """
        Take an action in the environment, update the state, and return the next state, reward, and done flag.
        """
        next_state = self.update_state(action)
        reward, done = self.calculate_reward(next_state)
        return next_state, reward, done
    
    def update_state(self, action):
        """
        Update the poker game state based on the agent's action.
        """
        # Logic to update the game state based on poker rules and outcomes
        pass
    
    def calculate_reward(self, next_state):
        """
        Return the reward for the action taken and whether the game is over (done).
        """
        # Retrieve reward using reward logic
        reward = calculate_reward(next_state)
        done = check_if_game_over(next_state)
        return reward, done
```

### 3. **`training.py`** - Training Loop and Simulation

This file contains the logic for training the agent by simulating multiple poker games. It runs the agent through episodes, updates the Q-values, and tracks performance over time.

#### Core Components:
```python
def train_agent(agent, environment, episodes):
    """
    Run multiple episodes to train the agent in the simulated environment.
    """
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = environment.initialize_state()
        done = False
        total_reward = 0
        
        while not done:
            action = agent.choose_action(state)
            next_state, reward, done = environment.step(action)
            
            # Update Q-values based on the state transition and reward
            agent.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
            
            state = next_state
            total_reward += reward
        
        print(f"Episode {episode + 1}/{episodes} - Total Reward: {total_reward}")
        # Optionally: Log or save performance metrics here
```

### 4. **`rewards.py`** - Reward Calculation Logic

This file defines the reward system for the poker AI. It assigns rewards based on the quality of the AI’s actions, including successful bluffs, winning hands, or correctly folding losing hands.

#### Core Components:
```python
def calculate_reward(game_state):
    """
    Calculate the reward based on the action taken and the game result.
    """
    if game_state['result'] == 'win':
        return 100  # Large positive reward for winning
    elif game_state['result'] == 'lose':
        return -100  # Large negative reward for losing
    elif game_state['action'] == 'fold' and game_state['hand_strength'] < 5:
        return 10  # Small positive reward for folding a weak hand
    elif game_state['action'] == 'bluff' and game_state['bluff_success']:
        return 50  # Medium positive reward for successful bluff
    else:
        return 0  # Default no reward
```

### 5. **`utils.py`** - Utility Functions

This file contains various utility functions for encoding states, calculating probabilities, and processing data. These functions are shared across different modules in the RL system.

#### Core Components:
```python
def encode_cards(cards):
    """
    Convert the player's cards into a numerical or one-hot encoded format.
    """
    # Example: Map card ranks and suits to integers
    pass

def calculate_hand_strength(player_hand, community_cards):
    """
    Calculate the numerical strength of the player's hand given the community cards.
    """
    pass

def check_if_game_over(game_state):
    """
    Determine if the game is over based on the current state.
    """
    return game_state['round'] == 'river' and len(game_state['community_cards']) == 5
```

### 6. **`evaluation.py`** - Performance Evaluation

This file contains functions for evaluating the performance of the agent, tracking metrics like win rate, average reward per episode, and decision accuracy over time.

#### Core Components:
```python
def evaluate_agent_performance(agent, environment, episodes=100):
    """
    Evaluate the agent's performance over a set number of episodes and return key metrics.
    """
    total_rewards = []
    
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = environment.initialize_state()
        done = False
        total_reward = 0
        
        while not done:
            action = agent.choose_action(state)
            next_state, reward, done = environment.step(action)
            total_reward += reward
            state = next_state
        
        total_rewards.append(total_reward)
    
    avg_reward = np.mean(total_rewards)
    win_rate = calculate_win_rate(total_rewards)
    
    return {
        'avg_reward': avg_reward,
        'win_rate': win_rate,
        'total_episodes': episodes
    }
    
def calculate_win_rate(total_rewards):
    """
    Calculate the win rate based on the rewards.
    A positive reward is considered a win, and a negative reward is considered a loss.
    """
    wins = sum(1 for reward in total_rewards if reward > 0)
    return wins / len(total_rewards)
```

### 7. **`config.py`** - Configuration Parameters

This file contains adjustable configuration parameters for the RL system, such as learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate, and the number of episodes for training.

#### Core Components:
```python
# Learning Parameters
ALPHA = 0.1  # Learning rate for Q-learning updates
GAMMA = 0.9  # Discount factor for future rewards
EPSILON = 0.1  # Exploration rate for epsilon-greedy action selection

# Training Parameters
EPISODES = 10000  # Total number of training episodes
EVALUATION_EPISODES = 100  # Number of episodes for evaluation
