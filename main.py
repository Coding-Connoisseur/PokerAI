# main.py

"""
Main entry point for the PokerAI program. This file ties together the various components of the project,
including reinforcement learning (RL), strategy engine, browser automation, and NLP chat. The functions below
are placeholders that describe the logical flow and role of each component in the overall system. The final
implementation will involve detailed logic, interaction between modules, and real-time decision making during poker games.
"""

def initialize_environment():
    """
    Initializes the environment for the PokerAI. This involves setting up the necessary
    configurations, loading data, and preparing the poker simulation environment.
    
    - Loads configuration files (e.g., RL hyperparameters, browser settings).
    - Prepares the poker environment where the AI will play.
    - Ensures that all necessary directories (e.g., logs, models, data) are in place.
    """
    pass

def setup_rl_agent():
    """
    Sets up the reinforcement learning agent for training or gameplay. This function handles:
    
    - Loading a pre-trained model or initializing a new RL agent (Q-Learning, DQN, etc.).
    - Defining the agent's parameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.).
    - Connecting the agent to the poker environment for decision-making during gameplay.
    """
    pass

def train_rl_agent():
    """
    Trains the reinforcement learning agent using the poker environment. This function will:
    
    - Run the agent through multiple simulated poker games (episodes).
    - Collect rewards and update the agent’s policy based on the outcomes.
    - Monitor and log performance metrics (e.g., win rates, cumulative rewards).
    """
    pass

def load_strategy_engine():
    """
    Loads the strategy engine, which includes predefined poker strategies and decision logic.
    This engine will work in conjunction with the RL agent to make in-game decisions.
    
    - Initializes pre-flop and post-flop strategies based on game theory.
    - Loads opponent profiling data for real-time adjustments.
    - Sets bluffing frequency, hand evaluation, and pot odds calculation functions.
    """
    pass

def start_browser_automation():
    """
    Starts the browser automation component that interacts with an online poker platform using Selenium.
    
    - Opens a web browser and navigates to the poker game site.
    - Automates table selection, joining a game, and making moves based on AI decisions.
    - Reads game states from the browser and feeds them into the strategy engine and RL agent.
    """
    pass

def engage_nlp_chat():
    """
    Starts the NLP chat module, enabling the AI to engage in human-like conversation during poker games.
    
    - Uses GPT models to generate chat responses based on game state (e.g., bluffing, friendly banter).
    - Sends chat messages at appropriate times (e.g., after a bluff or winning a hand).
    - Monitors opponents’ responses and adjusts conversation to maintain realism.
    """
    pass

def run_poker_simulation():
    """
    Runs a full poker simulation, tying together all components (RL agent, strategy engine, browser automation, and NLP chat).
    
    - Initializes the environment and prepares the AI.
    - Engages the RL agent to make real-time decisions during gameplay.
    - Utilizes the strategy engine to guide decision-making (e.g., when to bluff, fold, or raise).
    - Automates browser actions to play the game online.
    - Sends appropriate chat messages using the NLP engine.
    - Logs game results and adjusts strategies or retrains the agent as necessary.
    """
    pass

def evaluate_performance():
    """
    Evaluates the performance of the PokerAI after gameplay. This includes:
    
    - Calculating win rates, decision accuracy, and rewards.
    - Analyzing how well the AI is adapting to different opponents.
    - Generating visualizations and metrics to assess the overall performance.
    - Making adjustments to the strategy engine or retraining the RL agent if necessary.

def main():
    """
    Main function that coordinates the entire PokerAI system.
    
    - Step 1: Initialize the environment.
    - Step 2: Setup the RL agent and strategy engine.
    - Step 3: Start browser automation for real-time gameplay.
    - Step 4: Engage the NLP chat engine for conversational interactions.
    - Step 5: Run a full poker simulation where the AI participates in a poker game.
    - Step 6: Evaluate the performance and retrain the RL agent if needed.
