# Browser Automation Module

This module contains scripts and utilities to automate browser-based interactions on online poker platforms. It enables the PokerAI to autonomously play poker by simulating user input, detecting game states, and making real-time decisions during gameplay. This system integrates tightly with the reinforcement learning (RL) agent and strategy engine to allow for efficient and intelligent play.

## Directory Structure

- **`/actions`**: Scripts that handle specific browser actions such as clicking buttons, entering values into fields, and navigating pages. These actions are reusable and can be combined to automate complex interactions.
  - **`click_button.py`**: Simulates a click event on a specific button within the browser.
  - **`enter_text.py`**: Automates typing into input fields, for example, entering messages in the chat box.
  - **`navigate.py`**: Navigates between pages or screens on the poker platform, such as moving from the game lobby to a specific table.

- **`/drivers`**: Browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) required for Selenium to control the browser. Each driver corresponds to a supported browser like Chrome or Firefox.
  - **`chrome_driver.exe`**: Chrome browser driver executable used for automation.
  - **`firefox_driver.exe`**: Firefox browser driver executable.

- **`/scripts`**: Contains automation scripts that perform higher-level actions, such as joining a game, placing a bet, or reading the current state of a poker game.
  - **`enter_game.py`**: Automates the process of selecting and joining a poker table.
  - **`place_bet.py`**: Takes betting instructions from the strategy engine and simulates the bet placement in the browser.
  - **`read_game_state.py`**: Scrapes data from the screen to get the current game state, including the AI’s hand, community cards, opponent actions, and pot size.

- **`/helpers`**: Utility scripts to support the browser automation process, including wait mechanisms, error handling, and data extraction.
  - **`wait_for_element.py`**: Implements functions that wait for specific elements (e.g., a button or game state indicator) to become visible or clickable.
  - **`take_screenshot.py`**: Captures screenshots of the browser during gameplay, useful for debugging and tracking game state visually.
  - **`handle_popups.py`**: Detects and handles browser popups, such as advertisements or error messages, which may interrupt gameplay.

## Key Features and Enhancements

### 1. **Robust Game State Detection**
The browser automation scripts now include improved mechanisms for detecting critical game elements. With enhanced element selectors and fallback mechanisms, the AI is better equipped to recognize and react to different poker platform layouts. This ensures the system can adapt to changes in the platform's HTML structure and still function effectively.

### 2. **Error Handling and Recovery**
The module incorporates advanced error handling, with retry logic and page reload mechanisms. This ensures that if the browser crashes or an unexpected issue occurs (e.g., a disconnection or site layout change), the system can recover automatically and resume gameplay without human intervention.

### 3. **Multi-Table Support**
One of the new features is the ability to handle multiple poker tables simultaneously. The browser automation can open and manage several tables in different browser tabs or windows, tracking each game independently while interacting with them according to the AI’s decisions.

### 4. **Real-Time Decision Making**
The interaction between the browser automation and the strategy engine has been optimized to ensure that the AI’s decisions are executed with minimal latency. By integrating tightly with the RL agent, the system ensures that actions like raising, folding, or bluffing are performed promptly, giving the AI a competitive edge in fast-paced games.

### 5. **Automated Testing for Browser Interactions**
Automated tests have been introduced to cover key browser automation tasks, ensuring the system works reliably across various platforms. These tests simulate typical poker interactions as well as edge cases, helping to validate the system’s robustness. By running these tests regularly, developers can detect issues early and ensure consistent performance across updates.

## Usage

### 1. **Installation**
Ensure that you have installed all dependencies, including Selenium and the appropriate browser drivers. Install them by running the following command from the project root:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to download the relevant browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) and place them in the `/drivers` directory.

### 2. **Running Scripts**
To automate specific actions on the poker platform, run the relevant scripts. For example:
- To join a poker game: 
  ```bash
  python scripts/enter_game.py
  ```
- To place a bet:
  ```bash
  python scripts/place_bet.py
  ```
- To read the current game state:
  ```bash
  python scripts/read_game_state.py
  ```

### 3. **Monitoring and Debugging**
Monitor the logs and screenshots generated during gameplay. For debugging, the `take_screenshot.py` script captures the browser’s state at critical points, and log files help trace actions and errors during execution.

### 4. **Running Multi-Table Games**
To enable multi-table support, modify the configuration in `env_config.yaml` to allow multiple windows or tabs. Each browser session will be managed independently, and the AI will track and make decisions for all open tables simultaneously.

## Future Enhancements

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Expanding support for additional browsers like Safari and Edge to make the system more versatile.
- **Advanced Game State Detection**: Incorporating machine learning-based image recognition to improve the accuracy of game state detection, especially for more dynamic or complex poker platforms.
- **Dynamic UI Adaptation**: Improving the flexibility of the UI interaction layer to adjust dynamically to different poker websites and their potential layout changes.
- **Mobile Browser Support**: Adding support for mobile browsers to allow automation on mobile poker platforms.
