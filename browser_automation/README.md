# Browser Automation Module

This directory contains scripts and tools used to automate browser interactions for online poker platforms. The browser automation enables the PokerAI to autonomously participate in live poker games by simulating user actions, detecting game states, and making real-time decisions. It integrates with the reinforcement learning (RL) and strategy engine to enable AI-driven gameplay.

## Directory Structure

- **`/actions`**: Contains reusable browser actions like button clicks, text input, and screen navigation. These modular actions are adaptable across different poker platforms.
  - **`click_button.py`**: Handles button clicks (e.g., bet, raise, fold) based on AI decisions.
  - **`enter_text.py`**: Automates text input for chat interactions or form entries.
  - **`navigate.py`**: Automates screen navigation (e.g., joining poker tables, switching windows).

- **`/drivers`**: Contains browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) required by Selenium to control the browser.
  - **`chrome_driver.exe`**: The Chrome browser driver.
  - **`firefox_driver.exe`**: The Firefox browser driver.

- **`/scripts`**: Holds the Selenium scripts that interact directly with the poker game interface. These scripts are responsible for automating game-specific actions, such as entering a table, placing bets, and reading the game state.
  - **`enter_game.py`**: Automates the process of joining a game table, selecting stakes, and confirming participation.
  - **`place_bet.py`**: Places bets based on the AI's decisions after evaluating the game state.
  - **`read_game_state.py`**: Scrapes the browser for game state data such as player hands, pot size, and current bets, which are sent to the strategy engine.

- **`/helpers`**: Contains utility functions to support browser automation. These include tools for waiting on page elements, taking screenshots, and managing browser events.
  - **`wait_for_element.py`**: Waits for elements (e.g., buttons) to become clickable or visible, ensuring proper timing for actions.
  - **`take_screenshot.py`**: Captures screenshots for debugging or logging purposes.
  - **`handle_popups.py`**: Detects and closes popups or ads that might interfere with gameplay.

## Enhancements Based on Project Context

### 1. **Robust Game State Detection**
The browser automation module includes advanced mechanisms for detecting game state elements. Using platform-specific selectors, fallback methods, and error detection, it ensures reliable reading of key poker elements such as player cards, pot size, and betting actions. This is critical for providing accurate data to the reinforcement learning agent and strategy engine.

### 2. **Error Handling and Recovery**
The automation system is designed with robust error-handling logic. It includes retry mechanisms and page reloads for scenarios where the browser becomes unresponsive or site layouts change unexpectedly. This ensures continuous gameplay, even if errors or interruptions occur.

### 3. **Multi-Table Support**
To scale up, the module includes support for managing multiple browser instances or tabs simultaneously. This enables the PokerAI to play multiple poker tables at the same time, handling separate game states and decisions independently for each table.

### 4. **Real-Time Decision Making**
To minimize delay between AI decisions and browser actions, the automation module is tightly integrated with the strategy engine and RL agent. Decisions such as betting, folding, or bluffing are instantly executed within the poker platform, ensuring the AI competes effectively in real-time games.

### 5. **Automated Testing**
This module incorporates automated testing scripts to ensure the reliability of interactions across different poker platforms. Unit and integration tests validate browser actions, error handling, and game state detection, helping developers identify and resolve issues quickly.

### 6. **Logging and Monitoring**
The browser automation system includes automated logging and monitoring capabilities. It captures and logs every browser interaction, including actions taken by the AI (e.g., placing bets, folding), errors encountered, and performance metrics (e.g., response time for actions). These logs are vital for debugging, performance tracking, and ensuring smooth long-term operation of the automation.

- **Error Logging**: Captures details of any errors encountered during gameplay, including page load issues, element detection failures, and browser crashes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitors key performance metrics, such as action execution time, page response time, and the number of successful interactions, to ensure the system operates within acceptable limits.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Includes real-time logging to track AI actions and browser responses as they occur, providing insights into game flow and detecting potential issues early.

### 7. **Dependency Management**
Managing browser driver dependencies is critical for ensuring compatibility between the automation scripts and the browser used for gameplay. The system includes automatic checks for browser driver versions (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) and updates them to match the installed browser version, preventing compatibility issues that could disrupt gameplay.

- **Driver Versioning**: The module ensures that browser drivers (like ChromeDriver) are kept up to date with the latest browser versions, avoiding mismatches that can lead to automation failures.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: While primarily focused on Chrome and Firefox, the module can be extended to support other browsers by adding the appropriate drivers and adapting the automation logic.

## Future Improvements

- **Platform Adaptability**: Expand the browser automation module to support a broader range of online poker platforms, ensuring compatibility and adaptability for different site layouts and structures.
- **Enhanced Element Detection**: Implement image recognition or OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for detecting game elements like cards or player names, further increasing accuracy in game state detection.
- **Performance Optimization**: Refine browser interaction logic to optimize the speed and efficiency of real-time gameplay, especially in high-stakes games with fast-paced actions.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install Selenium and required browser drivers from the project root using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Run Scripts**: Execute the desired automation scripts (e.g., `place_bet.py`) to automate gameplay actions.
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check logs and screenshots for debugging or monitoring game state interactions.

The browser automation module is a critical component of the PokerAI system, enabling seamless integration between AI decision-making and real-time poker platforms. With robust error handling, multi-table support, real-time decision execution, logging, and monitoring, it forms the backbone of AI-driven poker gameplay.
